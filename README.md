# Gameplay
- Each level has a different obstacle setup.
- In each level the player drives 8 cars one by one.
- For each car, entrance and target points changes.
- Before starting to drive time freezes, and time unfreezes when player touches the
screen.
- After the player arrives at the target, time resets to the beginning and a new car spawns
at a different entrance for different target. Since the time resets to the beginning, now
the player can see previously driven cars.
- If currently driven car collides with obstacles or previously driven cars time resets again
and the player has to drive the last car with the same entrance and exit points.
